      "text": "The clear finish on your furniture is the protective layer between the wood and the elements.  Just like the paint on your house or car eventually breaks down, furniture finishes will become worn from UV rays and normal daily use.  Some finishes are more repairable than others, but they ALL will need attention at some point.  When your finish is beyond repair, it’s time to add a new protective coating to your furniture.  Let us carefully and safely hand strip the piece with a soy-based stripper, and you can keep your hands clean.  We use water based dyes to color the wood.  Dyes allow the grain of the wood to show, without pigments covering it as with normal stains.  We use environmentally friendly water-based finishes, as well as historical finishes."

      "text": "Unless carefully maintained, normal use can have a damaging effect on your furniture pieces.  Some pieces of furniture may have damaged finish and need to be refinished to protect the piece.  Or we may only need to wash the piece, apply color and finish where it has worn off and apply a coat of wax to protect it.  Our goal in restoration is to restore the piece to it’s original beauty as much as possible, but preserving the patina created by years of maintenance and use.  For antiques we prefer to use the same technique and materials the original builder used to help maintain it’s character and value.  Through our furniture restoration services, we can transform pieces that are dirty, worn and/or neglected into beautiful furniture pieces you will be proud to have in your home."

      "text": "If you have furniture pieces that are damaged, broken, or just a bit worse for wear, we can help. We offer furniture repair services that will make your pieces good as new!  In a time where furniture is cheaper than ever, you quickly realize how much value those older solid wood pieces really have.  The older pieces can go 20+ years without repair, while some modern pieces seem to be built to pass the quality control department and that’s it.  We can help with making the older piece as good as the day it was built, or make improvements on the modern piece that may only have glue starved joints.  Let us take a look at your piece that you thought wasn’t worth fixing.  We can help you make that piece as good, if not better, than when you bought it."
